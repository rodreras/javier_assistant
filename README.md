# Javier Assistant - My personal assistant

**Hello everyone!** This was a fun project that I developed to learn how to deal with new libraries such as pyttsx3 and speech_recognition.

I was inspired by [Programming Hero Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWvsXxDtEkU&t=598s). The structure was basically the same, but I changed the language and added a few more functions, such as the current weather.

If you'd like to remake this assistant, you must have the following libraries intalled: 
- pyttsx3
- speech_recognition
- pywhatkit

I also used `openweathermaps`for the forecasting.

I hope you enjoy!
